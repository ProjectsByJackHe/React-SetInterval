# React-SetInterval

**TL;DR** 

Use setInterval in React hooks to update state. 

* What is this for? *

- In react hooks, we use the React.useState() function in order to update state. This works most of the time, but runs into problems when you use javascript's setInterval function inside a React hook to update its state using useState. 

- This useInterval component serves as the replacement for SetInterval in React hooks to avoid complications and trouble.
